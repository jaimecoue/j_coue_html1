<!-- START HOW DID WE GET HERE -->

	<h1>HOW DID WE GET HERE?</h1>
	<img class="subdivider" src="img/subdivider.png"><br><br>
	<p>
It all started from a bit of experimentation with raw cacao. Anthony made a few simple chocolates from raw cacao powder as a healthy treat for himself and friends. When they were polished off in seconds, with demands for more, he knew he was onto something. Over the next few months he taught himself more about the art and science of chocolate making, an endeavour that eventually developed into Honest Chocolate.<br><br>
Meanwhile Michael was also experimenting with raw chocolate in London, with similar results. So on his return to Cape Town, when the opportunity came to join Anthony on his chocolate adventure, the decision wasn’t all that difficult.
The attraction was the diversity of making chocolate and being involved in something that continually changes, something both fun and rewarding.<br><br>
And it has been just that ever since. The first years of Honest Chocolate were spent working with raw cacao from Ecuador, but with the Chain of Positivity in mind our slabs are now made with organically produced Tanzanian cacao beans which we roast, grind, and temper in our Woodstock production kitchen. It was a three year process to find and build a relationship with Kokoa Kamili who supply us with our Tanzanian beans, but our efforts to create Bean to Bar ethical chocolate with a smaller footprint on the environment have been well worth it.<br><br>
